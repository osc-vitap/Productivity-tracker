### Project

Productivity tracker is an application built to help people stay focused on their tasks by
monitoring their activity. \
Applications and tools used can be deemed productive or not
based on both user preferences as well as the default settings. Users can also
customize the level of data they want to share.

The application specifically focuses on analytics, that is, statistics of the data collected
will be displayed for user to see and download
